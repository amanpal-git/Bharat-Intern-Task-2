# Stock Price Prediction with LSTM ðŸ“ˆðŸš€

Welcome to the Stock Price Prediction project using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model! ðŸš€ In this project, we explore the fascinating realm of stock market analysis and prediction using advanced machine learning techniques.

## About
This project delves into predicting stock prices utilizing the power of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for sequence prediction problems. Through this repository, we aim to provide insights into stock market analysis methodologies and offer a practical implementation of LSTM for stock price forecasting.

## Key Features
- **LSTM Model:** We employ LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network, for accurate and efficient sequence prediction.
- **Data Processing:** Detailed data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques are applied to enhance the quality of input data.
- **Visualization:** Visual representations of stock price trends and model predictions are provided for comprehensive analysis.
- **Evaluation:** Performance metrics and evaluation techniques are utilized to assess the accuracy of the LSTM model's predictions.
- **Easy to Use:** The codebase is designed to be user-friendly and can be used as a foundation for further research and development.
